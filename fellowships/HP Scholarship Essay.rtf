\f0\fs24 \cf0 I have always been involved in what I thought were two completely orthogonal fields\'97mathematics and physical design.  I loved hearing riddles and learning about slick mathematics proofs, but also building physical objects out of paper, pencils, wood and plastic.  It is a happy coincidence that, just as I began university, the world of tech around me was beginning to bridge the mathematical with the physical.  When I was a freshman in college, it was the very beginning of 3D printing and rapid personal prototyping, and the \'93Internet of Things\'94 was a phrase that had just been coined.  Enraptured by the possibility of creating physical, intelligent, responsive objects, I decided to major in Computer Science.  Four years later, as I apply for PhD programs in Computer Science, I am more than ever interested in how we can make the objects that govern our everyday lives more responsive to our needs, particularly via collecting data from portable biological sensors and interpreting this data into holistic views of our everyday lives via machine learning algorithms.  In my current research and in the future, I\'92m interested in analyzing data collected from EEG\'92s to }
